# 🦧 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict diabetes based on health, lifestyle, and clinical factors. The model is trained and evaluated using real-world health metrics like fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict the presence of diabetes based on patient data.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, AutoGluon
- **Dataset**: `diabetes_dataset.csv`
- **Key Features**: Blood glucose, HbA1c, Age, Cholesterol levels, Physical activity, Diet

---

## 🧪 Workflow

- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and dropped unnecessary columns.
- Feature Engineering: Created a `Diabetes` label based on medical criteria.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data distributions and correlations.
- Model Training: Used AutoGluon with multiple models including XGBoost.
- Evaluation:
  - Accuracy
  - Classification Report
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve and AUC Score
- Feature Importance Analysis

---

## 📊 Results

- **Most Important Features**: `HbA1c`, `Fasting_Blood_Glucose`, `Age`
- **Most Important Features**: `HbA1c`, `Fasting_Blood_Glucose`, `Age`
- **Model AUC Score**: ~1.0 (Excellent class separation)
- **Model Accuracy**: Very high (~97% to 99%)
- **Insights**: Blood sugar-related features dominate diabetes prediction.

- **Insights**: Blood sugar-related features dominate diabetes prediction.
